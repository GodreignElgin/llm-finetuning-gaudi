    "This example will Fine Tune the Llama2-7B model using Parameter Efficient Fine Tuining (PEFT) and then run inference on a text prompt.  This will be using the Llama2 model with two task examples from the Optimum Habana library on the Hugging Face model repository.   The Optimum Habana library is optimized for Deep Learning training and inference on First-gen Gaudi and Gaudi2 and offers tasks such as text generation, language modeling, question answering and more. For all the examples and models, please refer to the [Optimum Habana GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-habana#validated-models).\n",

    "### Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning with Low Rank Adaptation\n",
    "Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning is a strategy for adapting large pre-trained language models to specific tasks while minimizing computational and memory demands.   It aims to reduce the computational cost and memory requirements associated with fine-tuning large models while maintaining or even improving their performance.  It does so by adding a smaller task-specific layer, leveraging knowledge distillation, and often relying on few-shot learning, resulting in efficient yet effective models for various natural language understanding tasks.   PEFT starts with a pre-trained language model that has already learned a wide range of language understanding tasks from a large corpus of text data. These models are usually large and computationally expensive.   Instead of fine-tuning the entire pre-trained model, PEFT adds a task-specific layer or a few task-specific layers on top of the pre-trained model. These additional layers are relatively smaller and have fewer parameters compared to the base model.\n"

    "## Fine Tuning the model with PEFT and LoRA\n",

    "We'll now run the fine tuning with the PEFT method. Remember that the PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of extra model parameters, thereby greatly decreasing the computational and storage costs. Recent State-of-the-Art PEFT techniques achieve performance comparable to that of full fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Here's a summary of the command required to run the Fine Tuning, you'll run this in the next cell below. \n",
    "Note in this case the following: \n",
    "1. Using the language modeling with LoRA; `run_lora_clm.py`\n",
    "2. It's very efficient: only 0.06% of the total paramters are being fine tuned of the total 7B parameters.\n",
    "4. Only 3 epochs are needed for fine tuning, it takes less than 20 minutes to run with the openassisant-guanaco dataset.\n",
    "5. We are using a cached model on the Intel Tiber Cloud to reduce download time.\n"
